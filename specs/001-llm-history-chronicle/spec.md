**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "我需要创建一本关于大模型编年史的书籍，想要从transformer论文开始，llm中间的发展，chatgpt的诞生和发展，以及全球其他公司的进展，需要尽量详细，保持前后风格一致性和连贯性，可以插入一些八卦轶闻增加趣味性。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core Timeline Reading (Priority: P1)

A reader (technical professional, AI enthusiast, or researcher) wants to understand the complete evolution of large language models from the foundational Transformer paper (2017) through to modern LLMs like ChatGPT. They need a chronological narrative that connects major milestones and explains how each breakthrough led to the next.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental value proposition of the book - providing a comprehensive, chronologically-structured history. Without this core content, the book has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reading the complete timeline from Transformer (2017) to present day and verifying that all major milestones (GPT series, BERT, T5, ChatGPT, etc.) are present, chronologically ordered, and connected with clear narrative transitions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader opens the book, **When** they read from beginning to end, **Then** they encounter a chronological flow starting with "Attention is All You Need" (2017) and progressing through all major LLM developments
2. **Given** a reader is on any chapter, **When** they finish that chapter, **Then** the next chapter's opening provides clear contextual connection to what came before
3. **Given** a reader encounters a technical term or concept, **When** it first appears, **Then** it is explained in accessible language appropriate for the target audience
4. **Given** a reader wants to find a specific event (e.g., "ChatGPT launch"), **When** they scan the timeline, **Then** they can locate it through clear chapter titles and section headings

---

### User Story 2 - Company-Specific Development Tracking (Priority: P2)

A reader wants to understand the contributions and progress of specific organizations (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, Chinese companies like Baidu and Alibaba) in the LLM space. They need to follow both the technical achievements and the competitive dynamics between these players.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the institutional and competitive landscape is crucial for comprehending why certain developments happened when they did. This provides essential context but builds upon the core timeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by tracing mentions of each major company/organization through the book and verifying that their key contributions are documented with sufficient detail and context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader is interested in OpenAI's journey, **When** they read the relevant sections, **Then** they find coverage of GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 with connections to the company's evolution
2. **Given** a reader wants to compare Google and OpenAI's approaches, **When** they read both organizations' sections, **Then** the narrative highlights key differences in strategy, timing, and technical choices
3. **Given** a reader is curious about Chinese AI development, **When** they read those sections, **Then** they find comparable depth and detail to Western company coverage
4. **Given** a reader encounters a company for the first time, **When** that company is introduced, **Then** sufficient background context is provided

---

### User Story 3 - Technical Understanding (Priority: P2)

A reader with moderate technical background wants to understand the key technical innovations (self-attention, scaling laws, RLHF, etc.) without needing deep ML expertise. They need accessible explanations that clarify "why it matters" rather than mathematical details.

**Why this priority**: Technical understanding is crucial for appreciating the significance of each breakthrough, but should be accessible rather than academic. This enhances comprehension of the timeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a reader with basic technical literacy (but not ML expertise) read technical explanations and verify they can explain the concept's significance in their own words.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader encounters "self-attention mechanism", **When** they read the explanation, **Then** they understand why it was revolutionary compared to previous RNN/LSTM approaches
2. **Given** a reader sees "scaling laws", **When** they read the explanation, **Then** they understand the relationship between model size, compute, and performance
3. **Given** a reader learns about "RLHF", **When** they read the explanation, **Then** they understand how it enables ChatGPT to follow instructions better than GPT-3
4. **Given** a technical explanation includes an analogy or example, **When** a reader reads it, **Then** the analogy accurately represents the concept without misleading oversimplification

---

### User Story 4 - Engaging Anecdotes and Industry Stories (Priority: P3)

A reader wants to be entertained and engaged beyond just technical facts. They appreciate interesting stories about the people, decisions, and drama behind the technology - the "human side" of LLM development.

**Why this priority**: While not essential to the core information delivery, anecdotes significantly improve readability and reader engagement. They make the history memorable and help the book reach a broader audience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sampling anecdotes throughout the book and verifying they are: (a) relevant to the surrounding content, (b) factually verifiable or clearly marked as rumor/speculation, (c) enhance rather than distract from the main narrative.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader is reading a technical chapter, **When** they encounter an anecdote, **Then** it provides context or human interest that relates to the technical content
2. **Given** a reader reads an industry story or "gossip", **When** it involves unverified information, **Then** it is clearly marked as such (e.g., "reportedly", "according to industry sources")
3. **Given** a reader finishes reading an anecdote, **When** they return to the main narrative, **Then** the transition is smooth and doesn't break the flow
4. **Given** anecdotes are distributed throughout the book, **When** a reader samples different chapters, **Then** the frequency and style of anecdotes remain consistent

---

### User Story 5 - Visual Timeline Navigation (Priority: P3)

A reader wants to quickly grasp the overall timeline and major milestones through visual aids (timeline diagrams, infographics) before or while reading the detailed narrative.

**Why this priority**: Visual timelines help readers orient themselves and see the "big picture" before diving into details. This is valuable but not essential for the core reading experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by showing timeline visualizations to a reader and verifying they can identify major milestones and their relative timing without reading the full text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader opens a timeline diagram, **When** they scan it, **Then** they can identify the major eras (Transformer era, GPT era, ChatGPT era, etc.)
2. **Given** a reader uses a timeline as reference while reading, **When** they encounter a date or event in the text, **Then** they can locate it on the timeline
3. **Given** a timeline includes multiple parallel tracks (different companies/organizations), **When** a reader views it, **Then** competitive dynamics and timing relationships are visually clear
4. **Given** timeline graphics are embedded in the text, **When** a reader reaches them, **Then** they appear at contextually appropriate locations

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when dates or facts are disputed in the historical record? (Document both versions with clear attribution to sources)
- How does the book handle rapidly evolving current events that may change between writing and publication? (Include a "Last Updated" date and acknowledge areas of active development)
- What if certain company information is confidential or unverifiable? (Clearly mark speculation vs confirmed information; omit unverifiable details rather than presenting rumor as fact)
- How to maintain consistency when different sources use different terminology for the same concept? (Establish primary terminology early, note alternatives in parentheses on first use)
- What if technical explanations need to balance accuracy with accessibility? (Prioritize conceptual accuracy over mathematical precision; use footnotes or appendices for technical readers wanting more depth)
