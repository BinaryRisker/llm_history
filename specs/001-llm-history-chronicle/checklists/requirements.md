# Specification Quality Checklist: LLM History Chronicle Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (all clarifications resolved)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

All clarifications have been resolved with the following decisions:

### Question 1: Coverage End Date
**Decision**: Option A - Cover through October 2025 (current date)
- Maximum current coverage including most recent developments
- Acknowledges field continues to evolve rapidly

### Question 2: Source Access Level
**Decision**: Option C - Mixed approach (secondary primary + opportunistic primary)
- Primarily publicly available secondary sources (papers, articles, announcements)
- Opportunistic use of primary sources (interviews, insider access) where accessible
- Balances depth and feasibility

### Question 3: Target Length/Depth
**Decision**: Option A - Comprehensive (100,000-150,000 Chinese characters / ~300-450 pages)
- Deep coverage of all topics with room for detailed anecdotes
- Suitable for reference book with thorough technical explanations

## Validation Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Details**:
- Content Quality: ✅ All items pass
- Requirement Completeness: ✅ All items pass (clarifications resolved)
- Feature Readiness: ✅ All items pass

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ User responded to 3 clarification questions
2. ✅ Specification updated with clarified values
3. ✅ Checklist re-validated
4. **→ Ready for `/speckit.plan`** to generate implementation plan

## Notes

The specification is now complete and validated. All strategic clarifications have been resolved:

**Resolved Parameters**:
- **Timeline Coverage**: 2017 through October 2025 (maximum current coverage)
- **Source Strategy**: Mixed approach - primarily secondary sources with opportunistic primary access
- **Target Length**: 100,000-150,000 Chinese characters (~300-450 pages) for comprehensive depth

All aspects of the specification meet quality standards:
- User stories are clear, prioritized, and independently testable
- Functional requirements are specific and measurable
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Scope boundaries are clearly defined
- Assumptions are documented
- Edge cases are identified

**The specification is ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).**
