## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - MVP delivery
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (builds on timeline)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 (enhances technical explanations)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Can start after US1 - adds engagement layer
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Can start after US1 - adds visual navigation
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core timeline - NO dependencies on other stories (can start after Foundational)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Builds on US1 timeline - DEPENDS on US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Enhances US1 technical content - DEPENDS on US1 chapters existing
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Adds to existing chapters - DEPENDS on US1
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: References US1 events - DEPENDS on US1

### Within Each User Story

- Setup tasks before content creation
- Research before writing
- Chapter drafts before enhancement
- Citations added before validation
- Validation before marking complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational research tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once US1 complete, US4 and US5 can start in parallel (US2 and US3 depend on US1 sequentially)
- **Single-author workflow (default)**: Chapters written sequentially following dependency order, parallel [P] tasks within phases
- **Multi-author workflow (optional)**: Multiple chapter drafts can be written in parallel by different authors (requires coordination, see "Parallel Team Strategy" section for details)
- Organization profiles in US2 marked [P] can be researched simultaneously
- Technical concept cards in US3 marked [P] can be created simultaneously
- Anecdote research in US4 marked [P] can be done simultaneously
- Timeline enhancements in US5 marked [P] can be done simultaneously
- Polish phase tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all foundational research tasks together:
Task: "Create organization profiles for OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, Baidu, Alibaba"
Task: "Establish canonical Chinese terminology list"
Task: "Create company comparison timeline"
Task: "Create technical milestones timeline"
Task: "Set up citation bibliography structure"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Chapter Writing

```bash
# After completing Chapter 1, multiple chapters can be drafted in parallel:
Task: "Write Chapter 3 draft (GPT-2/GPT-3)"
Task: "Write Chapter 4 draft (T5/PaLM)"
Task: "Write Chapter 5 draft (RLHF)"
# (assuming different authors or sufficient time allocation)
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Company Profiles

```bash
# All organization profiles can be researched simultaneously:
Task: "Create detailed OpenAI profile"
Task: "Create detailed Google profile"
Task: "Create detailed Meta profile"
Task: "Create detailed Anthropic profile"
Task: "Create detailed Baidu profile"
Task: "Create detailed Alibaba profile"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~1-2 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~1-2 weeks for research and timelines)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~6-8 weeks for 11 chapters at 9,000-13,500 chars each)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - can a reader understand the complete LLM evolution?
5. Publish/share MVP if ready

**MVP Delivery**: Complete chronological LLM history from Transformer to present, 100,000+ Chinese characters, 50+ events documented

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~2 weeks)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Publish/Demo (MVP! ~8-10 weeks total)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced edition with company perspectives (~2-3 weeks additional)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Technical depth enhanced (~1-2 weeks additional)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Engagement improved (~1-2 weeks additional)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Visual navigation complete (~1 week additional)
7. Polish phase ‚Üí Final quality pass ‚Üí Publication-ready (~2-3 weeks additional)

**Total Timeline Estimate**: 15-20 weeks (3.5-5 months) for complete book

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple authors/contributors:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (~2 weeks)
2. Once Foundational done:
   - **Author A**: Chapters 1-4 (Foundation + GPT Era)
   - **Author B**: Chapters 5-8 (ChatGPT + Competition)
   - **Author C**: Chapters 9-11 (Chinese AI + Recent)
3. After US1 complete:
   - **Author D**: User Story 2 (Company enhancements)
   - **Author E**: User Story 3 (Technical depth)
   - **Author F**: User Story 4 (Anecdotes)
4. Stories integrate and polish together

**Parallel Timeline**: 10-12 weeks with 3+ contributors

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/topics, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Chinese-first language per constitution (all chapters in Chinese with English terminology notes)
- Âèô‰∫ãËøûË¥ØÊÄß enforced through ÂºïË®Ä/Â∞èÁªì structure per constitution
- Commit after each chapter or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Beta testing critical for accessibility validation (SC-004, SC-010)
- Total task count: 175 tasks
- MVP scope: Phases 1-3 (T001-T060) = 60 tasks for core timeline
