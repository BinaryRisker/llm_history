- ✅ T107: GPT-2 controversy researched
- ✅ T108: ChatGPT launch stories researched
- ✅ T109: GPT-4 development rumors researched
- ✅ T110: Key researcher stories researched

Research files created in `research/anecdotes/`

## Implementation Tasks Status Check

### Chapter 1 (transformer-revolution.md)

**Existing Anecdotes** (anecdote_count: 2):
1. Line 269-276: "论文差点叫'Self-Attention'" - ✅ Covers T112 (title origin)
2. Referenced but not detailed: Google Brain team culture

**Required Tasks**:
- ✅ T112: Transformer title anecdote - **ALREADY EXISTS** (lines 269-276)
- ⚠️ T113: Google Brain team dynamics - **PARTIALLY EXISTS** (team intro exists, but lacks specific anecdote)
- ✅ T114: Smooth transitions - **SATISFIED** (existing content has good transitions)

**Action**: T112 can be marked complete. T113 could be enhanced but current content is substantial.

### Chapter 3 (scaling-up.md)

**Existing Content** (anecdote_count: 2):
1. Lines 55-96: Detailed GPT-2 "too dangerous" controversy discussion
2. Line 110+: WebText dataset anecdote
3. Line 398+: GPT-3 naming controversy anecdote

**Required Tasks**:
- ✅ T115: GPT-2 controversy - **ALREADY EXISTS** (lines 55-96, comprehensive coverage)
- ❓ T116: GPT-3 API beta reactions - Need to check if exists

**Action**: T115 can be marked complete (content is more detailed than a simple anecdote).

### Chapter 5 (rlhf-chatgpt.md)

**Required Task**:
- ❓ T117: RLHF development behind-the-scenes story - Need to check

### Chapter 6 (chatgpt-launch.md)

**Required Task**:
- ❓ T118: ChatGPT internal launch expectations vs reality - Need to check

### Chapter 7 (ai-race-2023.md)

**Required Tasks**:
- ❓ T119: GPT-4 development anecdotes - Need to check
- ❓ T120: Claude development philosophy - Need to check

### Chapter 8 (meta-llama.md)

**Required Task**:
- ❓ T121: Meta LLaMA leak incident - Need to check

### Chapter 9 (chinese-development.md)

**Required Tasks**:
- ❓ T122: Chinese AI competitive dynamics anecdotes - Need to check
- ❓ T123: Regulatory environment anecdotes - Need to check

## Recommended Approach

Given the instruction: **"如果有冲突以当前存在的内容为主，任务可以进行调整"**

### Priority 1: Verify Existing Content
Check each chapter to see what anecdotes already exist and mark corresponding tasks as complete.

### Priority 2: Add Missing Anecdotes
Only add new anecdotes where content is truly missing, integrating smoothly with existing narrative.

### Priority 3: Validation (T124-T127)
Once all anecdotes are in place, validate:
- T124: 60%+ chapters have anecdotes
- T125: 2-3 anecdotes per chapter consistency
- T126: Verification ratio (70%+ fully verified)
- T127: Relevance to technical content

## Next Steps

1. Quick scan Chapters 5-9 for existing anecdote content
2. Mark tasks as complete where content exists
3. Add only truly missing anecdotes
4. Update tasks.md with adjusted status
5. Run validation checks
