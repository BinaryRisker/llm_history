       dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
       section Foundation
       Transformer Paper :milestone, 2017-06-12, 0d
       GPT-1 Release :milestone, 2018-06-11, 0d
       ...
   ```
   - Rationale: Per FR-011 requirement

4. **Expand Event Descriptions**:
   - Add 1-2 sentence context for each major event
   - Rationale: Helps readers understand significance without clicking through

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have):

5. **Create Era Summaries**:
